Introduction
============

This is a manual for the C99 parser provided with NYACC. It is a LALR(1)
based parser written in Scheme as implemented in Guile.  The grammar can
be examined by looking at the source code in the file
'nyacc/lang/c99/mach.scm'.  The parser has been used to generate object
code (see <https://www.gnu.org/software/mes/>) but it has options to
make it useful for processing C code in other ways.  For example, the
FFI Helper included with NYACC uses the parser to generate FFI (foreign
function interface) code for many C libraries.  It does this by parsing
the associated C header files.

 -- Procedure: parse-c99 [options]
     where options are
     '#:cpp-defs defs-list'
          defs-list is a list of strings where each string is of the
          form NAME or NAME=VALUE.
     '#:inc-dirs dir-list'
          dir-list is a list of strings of paths to look for
          directories.
     '#:inc-help helpers'
          helpers is an a-list where keys are include files (e.g.,
          '"stdint.h"') and the value is a list of type aliases or CPP
          define (e.g., '"foo_t" "FOO_MAX=3"').  The default helper is
          'c99-def-help' (see below).
     '#:mode mode'
          mode is one literal ''code', ''file', or ''decl'.  The default
          mode is ''code'.
     '#:debug bool'
          If bool evaluates to true, print productions as they are
          reduced.
     This will parse the content taken from the current input port until
     end if input is reached.  A parse tree in the form of an SXML
     expression is returned.  See below for the syntax.  This needs to
     be explained in some detail.  tdd = typedef dict: (("<time>"
     time_t) ...  ("<unistd.h>" ...))  Default mode is ''code'.
          (with-input-from-file "abc.c"
            (parse-c #:cpp-defs '("ABC=123"))
                     #:inc-dirs '(("." "./incs" "/usr/include"))
                     #:inc-help (append '("myinc.h" "foo_t" "bar_t") c99-std-help)
                     #:mode 'file))
     Note: for 'file' mode user still needs to make sure CPP conditional
     expressions can be fully evaluated, which may mean adding compiler
     generated defines (e.g., using 'gen-cpp-defs').

Include Helpers
---------------

The C99 parsers can use "include helpers".  This allows files to be
parsed without reading full include files.  The user provides typenames
(types defined using 'typedef') and defines.  The syntax for the
include-helper optional argument to the parsers is
     (define my-inc-helper
      '(("foo.h" "foo_t" "ABC=123" "SUM(X,Y)=((X)+(Y))")
        ("bar.h" "bar_t" "DEF=456" "MAX(X,Y)=((X)>(Y)?(X):(Y))"))

   The special helper '"__builtin"' will be "included" automatically at
the start of parsing.  This allows one to generate definitions for
compiler builtins like '__builtin_va_list'.
     (define inc-helper
      '(("__builtin" "__builtin_va_list=void*")))
If no inc-helper is provided, the default is 'c99-def-help', which is
defined (in the module '(nyacc lang c99 util)') as
     (define c99-def-help
       '(("__builtin"
          "__builtin_va_list=void*"
          "__inline__=inline" "__inline=__inline__"
          "__restrict__=restrict" "__restrict=__restrict__"
          "__signed__=signed" "__signed=__signed__"
          "asm(X)=__asm__(X)" "__asm(X)=__asm__(X)"
          "__attribute(X)=__attribute__(X)"
          "__volatile__=volatile" "__volatile=__volatile__"
          "__extension__=" "__extension=__extension__"
          "asm=__asm__" "__asm=__asm__"
          "__attribute(X)=__attribute__(X)")))
The module '(nyacc lang c99 util)' also defines 'c99-std-help', which
includes the above and typedefs and CPP defines for many standard
includes (e.g., 'alloca.h', 'limits.h').  See the source
'nyacc/lang/c99/util.scm' for more detail.

Misc Items
----------

The special symbol 'C99_ANY' can be used for symbols which you don't
want to define.  In the parser will handle this as XXX

Stuff
=====

Note on CPP replacement text: IIRC, C99 will remove comments from CPP
statements before processing.  I preserve this and remove inside the CPP
parser.

The Unit Parser
===============

TALK ABOUT 'fixed-width-int-names'

 -- Procedure: parse-c99 [#:cpp-defs def-a-list] [#:inc-dirs dir-list]
          [#:mode ('code|'file)] [#:debug bool]
     This needs to be explained in some detail.  Default mode is
     ''code'.
          (with-input-from-file "abc.c"
            (parse-c #:cpp-defs '("ABC=123"))
                     #:inc-dirs (append '("./incs") c99-std-dict)
                     #:inc-help '(("myinc.h" "foo_t" "bar_t"))
                     #:mode 'file))

Modes
-----

There are several modes for parsing which affect the way the C
preprocessor statements are handled, and how the parse tree is
generated.  The following list explains the intent behind these parsing
modes.  Later we mention some fine points.
   * _code_ mode (the default) In this mode, the proprocess works like a
     normal C compiler.  The preprocessor statements are evaluated as
     they are read and macros in the code are expanded as they are read.
   * _decl_ mode This mode is intended to be used for tools which want
     to extract the declarations and definitions which are explicit in a
     file, but allow access to declarations and definitions in included
     files.
   * _file_ mode is intended to be used for tools which want to
     transform C files somehow.  For example, one could parse a file and
     remove all comments.  This will keep the CPP structure at the top
     level.  Preprocessor statements at the top level are not evaluted.
     Note: There is a change in versions starting with 0.77.0.  In these
     all defines required for evaluating CPP expressions in if-then have
     to be resolved.

   Options are as follows
'#:cpp-defs'
     This is a list of define strings (e.g., ''("ABC=123")'.
'#:inc-dirs'
     This is an ordered list of directories to search for include files.
'#:inc-help'
     This is an a-list of include helpers, where keys are the include
     file or path (e.g., 'sys/types.h').
'#:mode'
     This is the mode: ''code', ''decl' or ''file'.  The default is
     ''code'.
'#:xdef?'
     This is a predicate function to determine whether to expand a
     definition (used in file mode).  See below.

   Note: The user needs to define
'"__has_include(X)=__has_include__(X)"' to enable has-include;
'"__has_include=__has_include__"' will not work.  (Should I worry that
it does not?)

 -- xdef?: name mode => #t|#f
     Given string NAME and MODE indicate whether the parser should
     expand using CPP defines.  The default is '(lambda(name mode) (eqv?
     mode 'code))'.
